  * Sign in as new IAM User
  * Create new key pair
  * Launch EC2 and add the key pair to it
  * Create security group for vm
    * Add Rule: Custom TCP Rule, Protocol: TCP, Port Range 8080, Source 0.0.0.0/0 
    * Add Rule: SSH Rule: Protocol: SSH, Port range: 22, From source, use the dropdown and select "My IP."

  * Commit and push changes
  * Create a [New personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,read:user,user:email,write:repo_hook)
  * Copy the token and save it somewhere.

* Set up GitHub account in Jenkins
  * Paste the personal access token in form in Jenkins. Click `connect`.
  * Search for `Static` repo and click `create pipeline`
  * Edit `Static` job
    * Select `Scan repository triggers`
    * Select `Periodically if not otherwise run`
    * Select an `interval` of 2 minutes

* Set up AWS credentials in Jenkins
  * Open main Jenkins page
  * Click on credentials
  * Click on `global` and then `add credentials`
  * Choose AWS credentials
  * add `aws-static` on ID
  * Add a description and fill in the AWS Key and Secret Access Key generated when the IAM role was created. Save it

* Set up S3 Bucket
  * Open S3 service for Jenkins user
  * Create a new bucket with default options and uncheck the "Block all public access"
  * Open the configuration panel
  * Select the `Properties` tab, and click on "Static website hosting" to enable it
  * Select the `Permissions` tab and add the following code in `Bucket Policy`:

                 }
             ]
         }
       ```
  * Replace 'NAME_OF_BUCKET' with the bucket that was just created and save it

* Set up pipeline for AWS
  * Edit `Jenkinsfile` in the `Static` repo by adding more stages
    * Add `Upload to AWS` stage to upload the `index.html` file using the region and credentials for AWS
    * Use [withAWS](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-aws-plugin#withaws) and [s3Upload](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-aws-plugin#s3upload) utilities from the `pipeline-aws` plugin
  * Save, commit and push. A new run should appear
  * To verify, go to: http://bucket_name.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com/. Replace region and bucket name accordingly.
    
* Add another stage in pipeline
  * Connect to the host where Jenkins is installed
  * Install the tidy linter in the server by adding following system dependency: `sudo apt-get install -y tidy`
